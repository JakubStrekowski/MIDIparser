# MIDIparser
A WPF application to generate levels for my Unity project - Dancer

Features:
- Listen to MIDI file by all channels or select a separate one
- Generate moves based on selected channel for a whole song or for a selected period of time
- Freely add and delete your own moves, you can also set a modifiable grid for precise positioning
- Modify colors of ingame UI and background for this level
- Add sprites during gameplay, move them and change their color over time
- Add preview image and music player during gameplay (can be different than loaded MIDI, but still should have the same tempo. Easiest way is to convert MIDI to wav)
